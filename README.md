# Authentication Server with Ktor and MongoDB Atlas

This project demonstrates how to build a simple authentication server using Ktor, a Kotlin framework for building asynchronous servers and clients, and MongoDB Atlas, a cloud-hosted database service for MongoDB.

## Features

- User sign-up: Allows users to create an account by providing a username and password.
- User sign-in: Allows users to authenticate with their username and password and receive a JWT token for authorization.
- Token-based authentication: Protects certain routes by requiring clients to provide a valid JWT token.

## Technologies Used

- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/): A statically-typed programming language for modern multiplatform applications.
- [Ktor](https://ktor.io/): A Kotlin framework for building asynchronous servers and clients.
- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas): A fully managed cloud database service for MongoDB.
- [JSON Web Tokens (JWT)](https://jwt.io/): A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.
